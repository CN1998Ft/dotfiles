# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles started with MacOs and Linux. Finally, with Windows too.

## macOs
> [!NOTE] 
> The sketchybar is created and integrate with aerospace. However, it is far
> from complete. Thus, not enabled.

- aerospace
- ghostty
- git
- neovim
- *sketchybar* [Unfinished]
- vim
- zsh
- starship

## Linux
> [!WARNING] 
> The Linux dotfiles were adopted from Omarchy Linux, but I am planning to use
> Fedora Linux. Not tested and migration has yet started. Will use gnome
> instead of hyprland. As Fedora is the plan and Wayland is the default, I am
> considering sway.

- ghostty
- git
- vim
- *~~hyprland~~* potential replacement [sway]
- starship

## Windows
> [!NOTE] 
> Since Windows does not have any tool like GNU/stow, we will create a
> PowerShell script to create symlink for the following configurations.

- neovim
- starship
- pwsh
- yasb
- glazewm
